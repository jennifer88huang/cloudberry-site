The `pg_controldata` utility serves a crucial role in PostgreSQL database administration by revealing control information related to a PostgreSQL database cluster. The information includes details initialized during the initdb process, such as the catalog version, write-ahead logging and checkpoint processing. It's important to note that the information is cluster-wide, and not specific to any individual database within the cluster.
